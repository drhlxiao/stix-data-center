# STIX data center

The Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) is one of the ten instruments onboard Solar Orbiter.  
It measures X-rays from 4 to 150 keV and takes X-ray images with a few arcsec angular resolution by using an indirect imaging technique,
based on the Moir√© effect.  
During nominal science operations, STIX continuously acquires data. They are compressed and formatted into different types of telemetry packets onboard by 
STIX onboard data processing unit. The total number of telemetry packets reaches hundreds. 
Being aware of the complexity of STIX data analysis and 
the need of bringing the data to the solar physics community, a data center has been
developed at FHNW. The data center (SDC) receives, analyzes, archives and distributes STIX data,
 and supports STIX in-flight operations.
It turns raw telemetry data into processed information and produces data products that can be used for scientific analysis.
It also provides various data visualization tools to the solar physics community.
The purpose of this is to describe the standard processing pipelines, 
algorithms of automated data processing, data products and tools provided by the STIX data center.
