# STIX data center
 The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) instrument onboard the Solar Orbiter mission launched on February 10, 2020 promises advances in the study of solar flares of various sizes. It is capable of measuring X-ray spectra from 4 to 150 keV with 1 keV resolution binned into 32 energy bins before downlinking. STIX data center is an infrastructure established at FHNW. It purposes include  processing and archiving STIX data, supporting operations of the instrument and providing data and tools to the solar physics community.
